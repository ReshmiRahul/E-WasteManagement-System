              E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded. They are electronic products that are unwanted, not working, and nearing or at the end of their “useful life.” Computers, televisions, VCRs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are everyday electronic products. 

              E-waste is the fastest growing waste stream in India with 3.2 million tonnes of e-waste generated a year, third highest after China and USA (According to ‘Global E-waste Monitor 2020’). Fast growing ICT sector is one of the prominent contributors to this increasing number of e-wastes. Upgradation and faster obsolescence of electronic products make consumers discard their products quickly, which in turn accumulate huge e-waste to the solid waste stream. Another challenge is that major recycling of e-waste is handled by the informal sector. The methods used for recycling are primitive and hazardous. This adds to the problem of climate change and pollution in India. These prevailing challenges make e-waste sector a major focal point for both government and industry.
